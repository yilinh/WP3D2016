\section{WP3 Tasks: Summary of Contributions}

\subsection{T3.1 Community Management}

\subsection{T3.2 Energy Consumer Profiling}

\subsection{T3.3 Interface with System Level}

The task 3.3 of CIVIS WP3 took care of exploring the different models for interconnecting the system level developed in WP4, the Energy ICT Platform, with the user level subsystem developed in WP3.

This work, performed between T02 and T08 of CIVIS project, was strictly in connection with the one performed in D4.3, where the interconnection of the two subsystems has been implemented and has been documented in D4.1, where the different models of interconnection have been described.

Sec. 8.3 of CIVIS D4.1 contains the descriptions of three different models that could be used in order to implement the connection between User Level and System Level:

\begin{itemize}
\item Solution 1: single connection and native HiReply MS SQL DB (Sec. 8.3.1 of D4.1);
\item Solution 2: single connection and use of a remote DB (Sec. 8.3.2 of D4.1);
\item Solution 3: double connection and use of a remote DB (Sec. 8.3.3 of D4.1).
\end{itemize}

Sec. 8.3 of D4.1 also describes the different features, in terms of scalability, that the three solutions can provide. For the deployment of CIVIS ICT Platform we adopted Solution 1, because it was suitable for achieving all the fixed goals in the provided project time frame and that is represented in Figure 1.
