\subsection{CIVIS Front-End as a Hybrid Application} 

The CIVIS front-end (YouPower) is developed as a hybrid (cross-platform) mobile application using Ionic\footnote{\url{http://ionicframework.com/}}, an HTML5 front-end development framework built with SASS\footnote{\url{http://sass-lang.com/}} and optimized for AngularJS\footnote{\url{https://angularjs.org/}} (a.k.a Angular).

The Ionic framework comes with native-styled mobile UI elements and layouts, and handles the look and feel and the UI interactions the app needs in order to be compelling\footnote{\url{http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/}}. 

Angular as a JavaScript framework provides directives (extensions of HTML attributes) and two-way data binding (binds input or output data of the view to a model) that simplify the app development with Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. 
In two-way data binding, the value of a data model is passed on from the view (or loaded from the back-end) to the controller at run-time, and the function in the controller returns the result (of the value manipulation) to the view.

The noteworthy JS and Angular libraries we use for the front-end development are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
 Highcharts\footnote{\url{http://www.highcharts.com/}}, a charting library in JS. It provides an easy way to add interactive charts to the application. 
\item Highcharts-ng\footnote{\url{https://github.com/pablojim/highcharts-ng}}, a simple Angular directive for Highcharts. 
\item Angular-translate\footnote{\url{https://angular-translate.github.io/}}, an Angular module for internationalization and localization of the application. (YouPower is currently available in English, Swedish and Italian.)

%\item Underscore.js, handy library that extends JavaScript with useful functions.
